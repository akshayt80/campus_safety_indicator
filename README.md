# Campus Crime Data Visualization
This project intends to develop a web based visualization tool that helps in making sense out of the
enormous campus crime data reported to the US Government. 

## Dataset
The crimes are categorized based on 5 different locations:

1. Non-campus crimes
2. On-campus crimes
3. Public property crimes
4. Reported by local authority
5. Residence hall crimes

In all of the above locations, the crimes are categorized according to five types of data:

1. Arrest data
2. Criminal offenses data
3. Disciplinary actions data
4. Hate crimes data
5. Vawa data

## Implementation
Backend developed using Python with Flask connected to Oracle DB. Frontend is developed in plain Javascript using Jquery and Chart.js
